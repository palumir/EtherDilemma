# API Configuration

This contains various files used for the configuration of the image the
Express application runs on, such as SSL/TLS keys, et cetera. Keys
generated by this application are self-signed and are not meant to be
Internet-facing, but rather maintain some confidentiality between the
Express server and the load balancer.

**This is not yet implemented in production and is a development-only feature.**

### Regenerating Diffie-Hellman parameters

Some pregenerated Diffie-Hellman parameters exist as `conf/dhparams`. These
can take a very long time to generate, so regeneration is off by default. To
turn on regeneration, set the environment variable `REGEN_DHPARAMS` which will
be picked up by `genKey.sh` and used to generate the parameters.
