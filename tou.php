<p dir="ltr"><strong>Fees and Payments</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">You hereby agree to, and acknowledge understanding of, all costs, fees, risks, and transactions associated with the game, MetaMask, and any third party Applications linked to our site. All financial transactions associated with the game must be conducted solely through the Ethereum network via MetaMask. We will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, the smart contracts associated with EtherDilemma, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum network or MetaMask. We do not have the ability to reverse any transactions associated with the game or site. All players and users of EtherDilemma understand and acknowledge the financial risks associated with interacting with the site and playing the game.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Additionally, we are not responsible for financial losses due to internet connection issues, bugs, or Application errors resulting in a player’s inability to successfully join, interact with, or play the game. The following transactions are thereby agreed upon by all players:</p>


<ol>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Gameplay Costs - You acknowledge and authorize us to collect 20 finney (20 one-thousandths of one ether) at the onset of each (and every) game of EtherDilemma played. This fee will be automatically collected from each player as an entry fee to play, and will be transferred to us through the Ethereum network.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Gas Costs - The Ethereum network requires the payment of a transaction fee (called ‘gas’, or a ‘gas fee’) for each and every transaction on the network. The gas fee funds the network of computers running the Ethereum network. Gas fees will be charged in EtherDilemma at two instances: (1) initiating matchmaking (joining queue), and (2) submitting your decision in each match. Players also acknowledge that if the gas fee is unpaid, or if transaction (2) is rejected, not submitted, or ignored, that player may forfeit the match and all rewards associated.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr">Gameplay Rewards - Players hereby acknowledge understanding of the custom reward system created by the developers to reward players based on the outcome of each (and every) game of EtherDilemma. The reward system is subject to change at the discretion of the developers at any time and will be displayed on the site. The reward system will be as follows unless otherwise stated:</p>

	<ol>
		<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">Games resulting in both players selecting ‘Ally’ will gift both players 26 finney.</p>
		</li>
		<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">Games resulting in one player selecting ‘Betray’ (player A), and the other player selecting ‘Ally’ (player B) will gift player A 36 finney. Player B will be gifted 0 finney.</p>
		</li>
		<li dir="ltr">
		<p dir="ltr">Games resulting in both players selecting ‘Betray’ will gift both players 4 finney.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p dir="ltr">Additionally, we have no control over fluctuations or changes with the Ethereum network, MetaMask, or any third party Applications resulting in changes to the agreed upon cost and reward structure. Players acknowledge that changes to such may result in changes to the value and cost of Ethereum, finney and gas.</p>

<br>
